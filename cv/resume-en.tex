% \section{RESEARCH \\EXPERIENCE}

%                 {\bf Invariant Feature Based Automatic Video Stitching in Wide Aerial Surveillance} \hfill (Feb. 2012 - Sep. 2012), NPU\\
%                 {\sl Project Description: } Algorithms for aligning images and stitching them into seamless photo-mosaics are among the
%                 oldest and most widely used in computer vision. Image stitching algorithms create the highresolution
%                 photo-mosaics used to produce today’s digital maps and satellite photos. They also
%                 come bundled with most digital cameras currently being sold, and can be used to create beautiful
%                 ultra wide-angle panoramas. Powerful methods such as autostich has been widely used. When it comes to handle the real-time video stitching problem that captured by a camera on a moving platform, those methods seems to perform too much computing. We expected to find an efficient solution for this particular task, using low cost approaches such as Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), etc to perform the relationships between video frames.\\
%                 {\sl Experience: }
%                 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
%                 \item I presented a fast approach for real-time video sititching using the MST method, its high efficiency was well accepted when dealing with the real-time moving platform video stitching problem.
%                 \end{itemize}

%                 %{\sl National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)}
%                 {\bf Camera Array Synthetic Aperture Focusing and Fusion} \hfill (Sep. 2011 - Jan. 2012), NPU\\
%                 {\sl Project Description: } Hidden object imaging is challenging problem in the fields
%                 of computer vision and image processing, and it’s a key step in many
%                 application fields, include intelligent video surveillance, visual tracking
%                 and scene understanding. Recently, the camera array synthetic aperture
%                 imaging has been proved to be a powerful technology for hidden object
%                 detection, and the state-of-art synthetic imaging method can focus on
%                 multiple parallel planes so as to achieve seeing hidden through severe
%                 occlusion. However, due to the depth variation of hidden object’s surface,
%                 it’s difficult for existing methods to get a complete clear image. Our goal is to find a novel framework for high performance hidden object
%                 imaging in which we integrate the camera array synthetic aperture
%                 imaging technique with multi-resolution image fusion method together, and also
%                 developed a hidden object imaging system with AXIS network camera array. \\
%                 {\sl Experience: }
%                 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
%                 %\item In this research I got more detailed information on Synthetic Aperture Imageing theory and got impressed by its advantage in dealing with occlusion problems.
%                 \item Together we proposed a novel framework adopting several multiple scale image fusion methods to create high resolution and highly detailed images of occluded objects.
%                 \end{itemize}

%                 {\bf Real-time Vision-based Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAV) Landing System}\hfill(June, 2011 - Oct. 2011),NPU\\
%                 {\sl Project Description: } Vision-based autonomous navigation is one of the hot and difficult spots of current researches in computer vision. A vision system on board an UAV typically arguments a sensor suite that might include Global Positioning System, Inertial Navigation Sensors, laser range finders, a digital compass and sonar. The design of any real-time vision system is a daunting task: It involves a systematic integration of hardware, low level image processing, multi-view geometry and synthesis of real-time controllers. This project aims to solve the problem of vision-based autonomous landing of an UAV, particularly on the technology of ground-based autonomous landing system, without any other sensors or assistances.
%                 {\sl Experience: }
%                 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
%                 \item I accomplished part of the pre-processing system, including highly accurate calibration of camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in wide-area scene, detection 、localization and tracking of an onboard cooperative marker, etc.
%                 \end{itemize}

%                 {\bf Moving Object Trajectory Based Infrared and Color Videos Registration} \hfill (Sep. 2010 - June , 2011), NPU\\
%                 {\sl Project Description: } Video surveillance has been widely used in many fields in recent years and moving target detection and tracking is an important part of it. Also tracking is the basis for further research on behavior recognition. The traditional target detection systems are limited by the sensors they use, so they cannot fulfill the demand in some long-term surveillance scenes. The visible and thermal based multi-sensor tracking system has been paid attention lately. This project focuses on the moving target detection and multi-target tracking algorithm and some other methods like shadow suppression and multi-source image fusion using visible and infrared spectrum videos.\\
%                 {\sl Experience: }
%                 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
%                 \item I presented a method and a novel criterion to
%                 register infrared and color (visible) videos. It is a feature point-based
%                 method that uses top pixel coordinates found after foreground
%                 detection and tracking to build trajectories which are used to find the transformation
%                 matrix in both visible and infrared videos.
%                 \end{itemize}
